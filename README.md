# Praxis

Praxis is a personal cognitive agent framework designed to transform learning into action.

It connects:
- AI reasoning (DeepSeek)
- developer workflows (GitHub)
- structured knowledge (Notion Life OS)
- iterative architectural thinking

The goal is not conversation alone, but synthesis — turning ideas, decisions, and experimentation into evolving software systems.
